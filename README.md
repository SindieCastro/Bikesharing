## Summary

The following bullets show that data from the bike-sharing program in New York can be used to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines:
- Find a tourist place like Manhattan for pick up and dropping of bikes
- Focus on marketing the program to males as the analysis shows that males are the highest users
- Focus on marketing the program to females who take longer trips
- Focus on getting subscribers

Lastly, for future analysis, it is suggested to capture the number of bikes that break down on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Also, focus on the cost of fixing the bikes as well as the profit vs. expenses.
